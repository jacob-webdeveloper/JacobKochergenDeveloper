## Sitemap and Site Functions ##
![Sitemap](<docs/Jacob's Portfolio Website Sitemap.png>)

On every page of the website is the navigation bar at the top that will allow you to navigate to multiple pages including:
- **Home** - The first page that the user will land on will be the home page that has a welcoming greeting. 
- **About** - This will be my general about me page that will contain some fun information about me such as hobbies and interests. This page will also lightly start to touch on work experience.
- **Projects** - This will be a page that showcases any projects that I think would be worth potential employers to see.
- **Skills** - This will showcase several different skills that I possess, and this will be further updated as I gain more coding specific skills.
- **Contact** - This page will contain ways that people can see more of my work on Github, and ways people can connect with me through LinkedIn and Email.

The individual links to my projects will be found on the projects page and each link will take the user to a seperate page that will have more information about the project and how it was created. The same page will also have a link to take the user to the specific project.

## Target Audience##
The main target audience is potential employers to be able to get to know me and see my work before they decide whether or not to employ me.

## Tech Stack and Features ##
The tech stack that I used are as follows:
- **Figma** - Wireframes
- **Draw.io** - Sitemap
- **VS Code** - IDE used to write HTML, CSS and README file
- **HTML** - For content on the website
- **CSS** - Used to style the HTML
- **GitHub** - Used to commit changes and host repository
- **Netlify** - Host and deploy website

The main features of the website that I focused on during the project is the accessibility of the website.
- Designed with a mobile first approach, using @media enquiries later to adapt the mobile site to the desktop. This ensured that the site is accessible and easy to use on mobile first but still fits and looks good on a desktop as well.
- The colours were specifically chosen as blue is my favourite colour I thought it best to incorporate some sort of blue. From that starting point each colour was chosen with care to ensure that every element stood out from the background and the elements around it. The font was also chosen for similar reasons as it was a very easy font to read and accessible to many different browsers.
- Semantic elements were used as much as possible with only a couple cases of div elements used to adapt the website to desktop.
- The navigation bar always being at the top ensured that the user can quickly and easily access the area of the site they wanted to access next. Specific pages such as the individual project pages were left out of the navigation bar, as I predict those pages will only be navigated to when exploring the projects, and not needed to navigate across the main site.

## Wireframes and Screenshots ##
I designed these wireframes using Figma. The screenshots will be displayed after each wireframe.
